                            <br>

                            <p>For experimentation, the force sensor is attached to a 4-axis CNC mill, where the reaction force applied to the shoe force sensors is measured by an external force sensor at the bottom of the setup. My co-researchers and I programmed a set of toolpath to simulate various components of walking: compression, shear, angled contact, and rolling. The force sensor at the bottom of the setup outputs accurate force measurements, and we compare voltage outputs from the shoe force sensor, and attempt to match the two sets of data. We also created finite element simulations using Abaqus to validate our results, finding functions to relate voltage output to force. I focused on analyzing and developing models for various angle compressions and rolling motions for the shoe force sensors. Below is an animation of one of the simulations created in Abaqus for analysis. </p>

                            <p>At Cambridge University, I worked on redesigning the stethoscope with a multidisciplinary team. Stethoscope is an outdated yet imperative technology for general physicians. It heavily relies on the hearing of the treating physician to pick up small irregularities, and it is difficult to procure a second opinion. We hope to design a stethoscope that will filter and extract critical sounds and provide real time data visualisation and feedback without disrupting the image and symbolism of the stethoscope. Our system will also become integrated with L2S2 database for future data storage. Below is the final presentation poster we presented to important stakeholders</p>

                            <p>I primarily focused on data visualization of sound data from the stethoscope, and designing the user interface for potential clients. I began with interviews with general physicians and other students who have worked on similar projects in signal processing. In early stages, I sketched out designs of potential user interfaces. </p>

                            <p>Through some research and testing with matlab tools, I decided to represent sound data using spectrograms. Spectrograms were able to give clear depictions of individual heart beat sounds and the intensity of the sounds. With that in mind, the final UI I designed incorporated the spectrograms, and is modified from previous design to allow more filtering customization and easy-data comparison. </p>

                            <p>I worked on producing the lid seal ring for the yoyo. The critical dimension of the lid seal was the inner diameter of the snap fit with the yoyo body. A 0.01 inch interference ensured the yoyo held together and would survive drop tests. </p>
                            <p>The mold of the part was designed in solidworks, later transfered to Mastercam for CNC lathe work. </p>

                            <h2>Lantern Lift</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/robot_front.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>For 2.007 Design and Manufacturing 1, I designed and fabricated a multi-stage lifting robot for an American Revolution themed competition. The goal of my robot was to lift a latern approximately 40 inches off the ground, and place it on the "Old North Church". </p>

                            <!-- insert picture of gameboard -->
                            <img src="img/portfolio/north_church.jpeg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p>I brainstormed and researchd various designs such as scissor lifts, rack n pinion, multistage lifts, and protyped them quickly with cardboard and foam. I created CAD models of potential grippers for grabbing lanterns, which would be attached to the lifting arm. </p>

                            <!--insert picture of cADDed gripper and prototype -->
                            <img src="img/portfolio/proto_1.JPG" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <img src="img/portfolio/gripper.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p>One of the important calculations I did for this robot was on the torque of the given motors, selecting the appropriate one powerful enough to lift a heavy mechanism. </p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/motor_calc.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p>After prototyping and testing, I decided on a multi-stage lift driven by a winch, string, and mini-pulleys. I chose a multi stage lift because it reached more height than a 6 bar lift, and more controllable than a scissor lift. If I opted for a rack n pinion, I would still have to build a multi-layer lift, and finding the right fit for a slot to limit movement of the rack n pinion would be a challenge. </p>

                            <p>For the first half of the class I built a prototype to test the multi-level lift. I found out my design did not have enough restraints on unwanted degrees of freedom. </p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/mvp.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p>During full production, I went with a design where each level is stacked in front of the previous level, and is connected and restrained by a sliding slot and linear bearing. My inspiration came from sliding drawers. The biggest issue I ran into with this design was minizing friction between levels, around the slot, while still giving enough constraint to allow only 1 degree of freedom. </p>

                            <table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="img/portfolio/lift_1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt=""></td>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

                            <p>For the final design, I had a multi-level lift with four wheeled two-wheel drive. This allowed less power usage than 4 wheel drive, and was easier to control. I opted for a spectula-like lantern lift, which was simple to make, modify, and took advantage of the fact the "lanterns" had two "legs" creating a slot underneath. </p>

                            <p>Although my robot was not a winning robot, I learned a lot throughout the process. I learned about the mechanical designing process, how to better manage my time to make the lab hours fit into my schedule. I learned to be patient, and that starting over and remaking the parts hoping for better tolerances is not always the solution. I learned to problem solve and improve upon the existing design to make mechanisms work, and to ask questions and utilize the resources around me. </p>

                            <p>2.00B toy design was the first design class I took. Coming in as a freshman at MIT, I was excited to participate in a hands-on project class with a child's heart and mind. </p>

                            <p>The class taught us the design process, from quick brainstorming, eliminating ideas, prototyping, to budgeting, interviewing our target audience, testing, and presentation.</p>

                            <p>The toy my team (team ostrich) created was "Texture Sketcher". The target audience are children in pre-school. Texture Sketcher is a drawing kit that allows kids to easily add in textures to their coloring books. It acts as a container for coloring tools and a drawing surface that sits nicely in a child's lap so children can take it with them wherever they go. </p>

                            <p>Texture Sketcher's outer structure is made using thermoformed ABS plastics. The black surface is a magnetic surface where "texture" magnetics can easily stick on. The "textures" were cut using a vinyll cutter. </p>

                            <p>During our testing sessions with kids in the Boston children's musuem, we received positive responses from parents and kids. They really enjoyed the added feature of drawing textures as well as the freedom of design their own textures. </p>

                            <p>The hammock represents my interpretation of symbiosis. Symbiosis in this case is interpreted as the coexistence between generations, old and young. However, as technology develops and time passes, the new generations is slowly beginning to lose their roots. The younger generations have slowly formed its own culture, the simple and bland. </p>
                            <p>In attempts to connect the younger generation with its roots, the hammock act as a means of promoting storytelling, especially stories of culture and tradition. A voice recorder is installed separately but next to the hammock, with directions that prompts people to record and listen to the existing recordings. The hammock is oriented such that the colorful side, traditional side, is closest to the voice recorder. The painting on the hammock fades to white canvas as the fabric is further away from the recorder. The pattern on the hammock was painted to stimulate conversation relating to culture and passage of time. The pattern represents my Chinese roots, with ancient Chinese scripts slowly changing to simplified Chinese scripts. The hammock is made big enough for two people to sit and lay there to begin a conversation. </p>
                            <p>This hammock can be seen as both an installed piece of painting or an object of interaction, ideally both. The goal is to have the hammock become the starting point of many conversations and the continuation of storytelling.

                            <p>This project taught me to put meaning to every descision of my design. The critics gave me advice on how, for an intereactive piece, I must find a way to engage the audience the way I intended it through user-testing and iterations. </p>

                            <p>This is an interpretation of a time machine. As we go through our lives, we attempt to make marks and impressions around us. We hope that our existence has a meaning, and maybe the future generation will remember. </p>

People can come up to it and leave their marks, write whatever they want with a magnet. But their marks only lasts for a day. Only a faint trace will be left. Similar to the marks we make in real life, it starts out strong, but it's only a matter of time before it fades away. </p>

This class showed me how to think like a designer and design with a purpose. For the first time I became aware of my ridgid and straightforward way of thinking as an engineer. It challenged me to be creative and think outside the box. This class also taught me the importance of presentation, and how it can manipulate perspectives. My group and I focused on video and photo presentation, and we had a challenging time portraying an abstract concept through media. </p>

                            <p>Chora is a web application designed for choreographers so that they can better plan formations and transitions for their pieces, making the choreographing process smoother. 
                            <h3> Design Features </h3>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/chora_1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="".>
                            <p>The login page in our scheme, designed to be simple and efficient. </p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/chora_2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="".>
                            <p>The dashboard was designed to be pinterest style. Each of the icons are draggable objects so that the user can customize the look of the dashboard as they like. </p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/chora_3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="".>
                            <p>The menu was designed so that users would have easy access to their dancers, increasing the efficiency of the system. The close proximity reduced the mouse distance needed to select a dancer. The trash was placed below to simulate the action of ‘dropping’ a piece into the trash as a form of natural mapping. One a user name is selected from the menu, it is erased. This is to provide visual feedback to the user, and increase the efficiency by reducing the menu-size with each plot. </p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/chora_4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="".>
                            <p>The color menu was designed to mirror the dancer menu, but with colors. The large size of the selections made the feature efficient. The color menu appears intuitively on the second click, adding to the learnability of the system. Anonymous dancers cannot have their colors changed because they do not yet have an identifier. </p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/chora_5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="".>
                            <p>Transitions were designed to work from the previous formation slide. The previous slide is copied and faded out. The user can drag from a dancer’s original position to their new position, with an arrow recording the movement. These new positions are changeable (the user can re-drag the dotted circle and replace the end point). Additionally, new dancers can be plotted on a transition side. This is so that transitions that involve entering the stage by different dancers is also possible. Transition slide menus mirror those of the original formation slide. </p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/chora_6.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="".>
                            <p>We included preset formation templates that is easily accessible via the side menu bars. This feature will help make the process more efficient since choreographers can reuse common and previous formations, spending less time moving the mouse around the screen. It also serves as a starting point to generate new formations. </p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/chora_7.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="".>
                            <p>Ghost slides are not editable but display the slide directly before and after the current slide edited. This helps users keep track of their progress and more easily visualize transformations from one formation to the next. </p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/chora_8.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="".>
                            <p>
                            We included an audio portion to the project. This is to help users keep track of where in the song they’re choreographing, marked by the ticks above the waveform. If we were to extend this project in the future, we would include the option to drag the music slider and place formations/transitions wherever the user wanted to place them. </p>

                            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
                            <p>It is eye-friendly yet engaging. In order to see contrast and provide more options in grouping dancers, we also included a palette with a wider range of colors. </p>

                            <p>I grew up in a community where suicides were common. My high school was known in bay area, CA as "the school with suicides". Before I entered high school, there was at least 1 suicide a year. During my high school career I was fortunate not to lose any of my classmates. However, the year after my graduation my high school lost three members in its community. More than 10 of classmates my year came out with their mental health struggles in high school on facebook. My freshmen year at MIT, we lost three members in our community, including one my year. </p>
                            <p>When I joined DFA and was given a chance to tackle a problem in the community I deeply cared about, I wanted to learn about mental health. I was fortunate to be matched with three other students who were also deeply passionate on the topic and were involved in various communities on campus tackling mental health on campus.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/DFA_team.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p>We focused primarily on the MIT community. Through various student interviews, it was clear to us that students are not getting the help they needed. Due to stigma against mental health, and even just being emotional, people are resistant to opening up about their emotional struggles. Instead they hide how their feeling and not seeking the help they need. This is why we want to make mental health tangible and increase awareness. We want people to understand that things like depression or anxiety are as serious as broken bones. </p>

                            <p>Campus Feels, a web application portal we are designing, aimes to change the mental health climate at MIT. Campus Feels will allow MIT students to each have a personal interface and dashboard. Each user has the option to input their mood and feelings into the system. With the data gathered from many students, Campus Feels will display the mood the campus. Using the data we collect, we want to show students that they are not alone. We all experience stress. We all experience times where we are overwhelmed. And most importantly, it’s not a weakness to admit this and reach out for help. We feel that the anonymity of Campus Feels, our project, will help students begin talking about how they feel. </p>

                            <p>The UI design for our web application is shown below: </p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/Campusfeels_website layout_new.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">


                            <p>By beginning this conversation, we hope that people will be more open to sharing their hardships and seeking help when they need it. In addition to sharing these struggles, Campus Feels is a medium to express why we are happy and share that happiness with others. It is often forgotten that we all chose to come here and that there are many reasons why MIT is amazing. It is important to be reminded of these positive things that are often lost during stressful times.</p>

                            <p>Another aspect of our website is that it bridges the gap between the administration and students. It allows the administrators to understand what MIT students are feeling and understand how they can help. </p>
                            <p>The biggest challenges in design the user-interface are how to quantify feelings and moods, and how we can integrate this website as part of MIT culture. We want to keep students engaged so we can have a constant stream of data. We played around with various data input methods, finding a balance between convenience, efficiency, and accuracy. We are also in contact with mentors about ways we can gamify the application to keep students engaged. </p>
                            <p>The user-interface we have so far is shown. Our next step includes finish implementing the application, testing, and reiteration.</p>

                            <p>MakeMIT has a special place in my heart because not only was it one of the most valuable experiences at MIT, but I also found a team. </p>
                            <p>MakeMIT is a hardware hackathon. Our goal is to foster creativity amongst our hackers. We provide materials such as 80/20, arduinos, motors, wires, legos, and more. We also provide hand tools, drill press, table lathe, and option to have parts 3D printed and laser cutter by trained volunteers. We take suggestions from hackers for what they want and need for them to prototype their ideas. </p>
                            <p>As a organizer, my goal is for all attendees have the best experience possible. I arranged event logistics such as an efficient check-in system, manage sponsorships, volunteers, and make sure all attendees are actively engaged. </p>
                            <p>Being on the organizing team forced me to step out of my shoe and think from different perspectives. It taught me to always be prepared and have a backup plan. The most rewarding part of the experience is the expo review, where at the end of the hackathon, hackers show us and the judges their progress. The projects vary from fun hacks such as hot dog makers, automatics spicers, to holograms and machines to help the blind. I am constantly amazed by the creativity and capability of our hackers, and am proud to have helped hackers achieve their goals. </p>
                            <p>Through organizing MakeMIT, I also learned to work in a team. I learned to be a teammate and leader. Someone who others can rely on but also seek as a resource. </p>
